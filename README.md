  ## Description
  This project/application is a retooling of a portfolio website.  The prior portfolio applications that I created worked as intended but did not allow for users to acutally save messages.  This newest version of the portfolio site includes a database that stores messages posted.  This project is a MERN stack project; it uses Redux to store global state; it uses GraphQL to handle database interactions.

  ## Installation
  
  To install a similar project, a user would need to clone the files in the application and run the appropriate npm install commands to install the necessary packages in both the client and server directories of the project.  The project utilizes certain environment variables, so a user would need to choose his/her own versions of such variables and include them in a .env file.
  
  ## Usage
  
  This is a portfolio project, and thus, there is not any true usage of the application beyond posting messages.
